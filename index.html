<a id="report"> <h2>Director's Report</h2> <h5>Dr. Emmett Duffy, Director of
TMON</h5> <img
src="img/Emmett_small.png"
class="figure" style="width:100px;margin-top:-10px;">


<br><br>

Dear Friends and Colleagues, <br><br> TMON and the <a href =
"http://marinegeo.si.edu/" target = "_blank">MarineGEO</a> program have had a
busy summer and fall since our last (first!) newsletter in May. The program is
rapidly gaining momentum and global visibility—and starting to bear tangible
fruit, as detailed in this newsletter. I’d like to hit a few highlights here.

<br><br>

The world is awakening, suddenly it seems, to the inadequate state of the
knowledge we need to protect and manage ocean life and ecosystems. Much effort
and investment have gone into ocean observing in recent decades, with impressive
results, but biology and especially biodiversity have been left behind. That is
now changing, quickly. Over the last few years several national and global
efforts have gathered steam to address the uncoordinated state of marine
biodiversity observations. The Smithsonian’s TMON is emerging as a leader in
this milieu. In November I attended the <a href = "https://www.earthobservations.org/index.php" target =
"_blank">Group On Earth Observations</a> (GEO) plenary meeting in Mexico City,
along with a 50-member US delegation including Secretary of the Interior Sally
Jewell and colleagues from NOAA and NASA, where we began stitching together the
various interested parties and hammering out the outlines of a truly global
Marine Biodiversity Observation Network. It’s an exciting time as the community begins to coalesce
toward a common goal, and to align our science with the needs of conservation
and management.

<br><br>

 A central challenge in achieving such a global network is agreeing on research
 priorities and what needs to be measured to achieve them—the “Essential
 Biodiversity Variables” in the current parlance. MarineGEO has been working
 toward this goal from the outset by field-testing a range of observational and
 experimental protocols for understanding marine biodiversity and its role in
 coastal ecosystems. This biodiversity focus dovetails with a strong program of
 chemical and physical environmental observations, including establishment of
 NOAA sentinel sea site sea level monitoring stations at the all of the
 Smithsonian’s marine field stations. With help from the Smithsonian Grand
 Challenges Consortia, the TMON team launched a field campaign at the Carrie Bow
 Cay station in September. Building on the rich legacy of work by the <a href =
 "http://ccre.si.edu/" target = "_blank"> Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems</a>
 (CCRE) program, the team conducted intensive fish and benthic community surveys
 in reef, mangrove, seagrass, and sand-patch habitat using the standard
 protocols we are helping to disseminate with the <a
 href="http://www.icriforum.org/gcrmn" target = "_blank"> Global Coral Reef
 Monitoring Network</a> and <a href = "http://reeflifesurvey.com/" target =
 "_blank">Reef Life Survey</a> program. The Belize campaign featured our first
 extensive deployment of standard assays we developed for measuring the feeding
 activity by fishes that is critical in maintaining coral dominance on reefs.
 One of these assays, the “squidpop”, was designed as a simple tool we hope to
 disseminate for students and citizen science, <a
 href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142994"
 target = "_blank">recently published</a> in the open access journal PLoS One.
 And the crew capped off the campaign with a well-attended evening outreach
 event for our neighbors in the village of Dangriga. Similar activities are
 completed or underway at TMON’s other <a href =
 "http://marinegeo.si.edu/places" target = "_blank">field sites</a> at Bocas del
 Toro in Panama (STRI), Indian River in Florida (SMS) and the Rhode River in
 Maryland (SERC). MarineGEO is now launching into the Pacific with active
 planning for field campaigns in summer 2016 at partner sites in Kane 'ohe Bay,
 Hawai'i, the central coast of British Columbia, and eventually Tasmania.

<br><br>


To achieve the grand goals of a global network we need strong partners. Over the
last few months MarineGEO has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with <a
href="#devo">Hong Kong University</a>, and is near doing so for the <a
href="#devo">Hakai Institute</a> in British Columbia, Canada. We have embarked on
a partnership <a
href="#grants">funded</a> by the Australian Research Council with the University of Tasmania and
expect to begin establishing our southernmost MarineGEO site there within the
coming year. Many other partnership conversations are in progress—indeed we are
working hard to balance the demand from prospective new partners with
implementing MarineGEO research at our existing sites. A happy situation to be
in.

<br><br>

At the heart of all we do are great people. We are fortunate to have attracted
an outstanding cadre of staff and fellows to TMON and the MarineGEO program.
Most recently, we’ve been joined by <a
href="#newstaff">Mike Goodison</a>, an experienced and multi-talented marine
scientist, as our MarineGEO Technician at SERC—welcome Mike!  Best wishes to all
for a happy and healthy holiday season,

<a id="newstaff"> <h2>Mike Goodison joins us as the MarineGEO tech at SERC</h2>
<br> MarineGEO is delighted to welcome our newest technician to the TMON team at
the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. He joins his colleagues Dean
Janiak from the Smithsonian Marine Station, Janina Seeman from the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute's Bocas del Toro Research Station, and Ross Whippo
from MarineGEO Central. Please join us in welcoming Mike aboard!

<br> <br>

<img src="img/mike_small.JPG" class="figureleft" style="width:120px;padding-top:0px"> <b>Michael
Goodison</b> has been a technician at the Smithsonian Environmental Research
Center since 2002, working in the Fish and Invertebrate Lab. He has been
involved in numerous projects over the course of his fourteen years in the “Crab
Lab”, including documenting and monitoring spring spawning runs of both alewife
and blueback herring using DIDSON imaging sonar, tracking the movement,
migration, and habitat usage of invasive blue catfish by surgically implanting
acoustical tags in individual fish, and a blue crab stock-enhancement project
that looked at the feasibility of enhancing local blue crab populations with
hatchery reared juveniles.  Mike received his M.S. degree from the University of
Maryland, College Park in 2002, is a scientific certified scuba diver, and
obtained his U.S. Coast Guard captain’s license (Master 50 Tons Inland and Great
Lakes with Towing Endorsement) in 2005.  Mike will coordinate and assist with
MarineGEO research activities at SERC.

<a id="postdocresearch"> <h2>MarineGEO Post-docs Research Updates</h2>

<br>

All four MarineGEO post docs have been very busy with their research this
summer. From bioacoustic measures of biodiversity to seasonal effects of
predation, their work has stretched from the tropics of Belize to the temperate
waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Here is a brief update on their progress:

<br><br>

<b>Brian Cheng</b> is examining whether predation rate is stronger in the
tropics as opposed to the temperate zone. He has recently wrapped up field
research measuring predation in Belize, Virginia, and Connecticut. Initial
results were counter to expectations because predation was found to be a strong
force at temperate as well as tropical sites! He is currently working out of
Maryland (SERC) to process field samples and analyze the data. Pending results,
Brian will be working in Panama during the spring/summer of 2016.

<br><br>

Over the past six months, <b>Lisa Schile</b> has almost completed the field work
component of her research. She finished taking deep soil cores in the marshes,
mangroves and seagrass beds in San Francisco Bay in California, Wachapreague,
Virginia, and the Indian River Lagoon in Florida. She currently is processing
the soil to quantify the soil carbon pools. Lisa continues to collect tidal
water samples within marsh and mangrove channels at all of her sites to quantify
dissolved carbon fluxes over tidal cycles. She also completed the teabag
decomposition experiment in San Francisco, Virginia, and Maryland and is
currently analyzing them to determine decomposition rates. In October, She
deployed the last teabag plots within a mangrove and seagrass bed in Florida,
which will be collected in January.

<br><br>


MarineGEO post-doctoral fellow <b>Erica Staaterman</b> joined us in August to
begin her fellowship tenure. Erica will be examining acoustic habitats in the
ocean and their relationship to biodiversity. She has been developing her
project plan, getting to know the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, and has collected
some preliminary data. From January-March 2016, Erica will be at STRI collecting
acoustic data alongside the rest of the MarineGEO team. From March onwards she
will be conducting her research at SERC. She plans to explore several projects.
An acoustic time-series – when combined with ongoing long-term data collection
at SERC - will reveal relationships between acoustic activity and seasonal
migrations of estuarine species. Acoustic recordings at oyster reef restoration
sites in Harris Creek will be used to explore the process of recovery for these
fragile ecosystems.  Finally, she will test whether boat noise leads to an acute
stress response in a suite of estuarine species through a series of playback
experiments. This work will shed light on the extent to which estuarine species
are affected by noise and whether they are able to acclimate to noisy
environments. Check out a profile of Erica recently published in the <a
href="http://sercblog.si.edu/?p=6700" target="_blank">SERC newsletter</a>.

<br><br>

After having spent the first month behind his desk fine-tuning his project,
applying for permits, and planning field trips, <b>Simon Brandl</b> has just
returned from SMS Fort Pierce in Florida. During his week in Florida, he tested
some of the methods he plans to employ during his big trip in the first half of
2016 to STRI in Panama. One of the questions he attempted to answer included how
well his proposed fish and invertebrate collection method, via an underwater
suction pump worked. In 2016, he will be travelling for the first half of the
year, visiting field stations in Panama, Belize, Florida, North Carolina,
Massachusetts, and Maine to set up his experiment. Besides sampling fish and
micro-invertebrates, he will be building cages, scraping material of pilings,
and monitoring predation.

</div> Experiments and observations are underway at TMON sites. MarineGEO staff
and partners have been busy conducting research in the field over the past year.
In addition to data captured at our sites in Maryland, Florida, Belize, and
Panama, we  also traveled in teams to Belize and Florida to test new methods and
identify new sites for the network.


<br><br>

<b>Carrie Bow Cay, Belize</b>

<br><br>

In February 2015 TMON teams traveled to the Smithsonian's research station at <a
href="http://www.ccre.si.edu/CarrieBowCay/CarrieBowCay.html"
target="_blank">Carrie Bow Cay</a> in Belize to continue the long-term research
projects and add new components. From September 16-30, 2015 at Carrie Bow
Station in Belize, biologists, technicians, and dive staff from SMS, STRI, the
SI Dive Office, and TMON/MarineGEO implemented and completed a full compliment
of observational and experimental activities that currently form the basis of
the MarineGEO field program. A total of six habitat types (fore reef, lagoonal
reef, mangrove, seagrass, sand flats, and docks) were surveyed over three
general regions (immediate vicinity of Carrie Bow, North, and South of Carrie
Bow) for foundation species cover and recruitment, fish community (abundance,
biomass, and diversity), invertebrate community composition (diver and photo
surveys), and water quality (temperature, salinity, pH, etc.), depending on the
specific habitat. Process assays including predation and herbivory experiments
were deployed, and sessile invertebrate recruitment panels were retrieved from
the field. Additionally, corals were tagged for long-term monitoring. The TMON
team also had an opportunity to lead a "Science Cafe" public education event at
the Pelican Resort in Dangriga, Belize. Many locals including students and
families attended to hear presentations by MarineGEO scientists Scott Jones,
Justin Campbell, Janina Seemann, Dean Janiak, and Ross Whippo. Staff of the
resort praised the event as a "great success" and suggested that the "Science
Cafe" could become a regular part of their community outreach initiatives.

<b>Fort Pierce, Florida</b>

<br><br>

Matt Ogburn and Mike Goodison traveled to Ft. Pierce and worked with Dean Janiak
to conduct fish surveys using Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON). The
sonar produces high-resolution video images of fish in clear or turbid water.
The sonar unit was deployed just below the surface from the bow of a small boat
and pointed either directly in front or 90 degrees to the side depending on
whether a habitat was fully submerged or was a shoreline. They conducted 50 m
survey transects across or along soft sediment, seagrass, mangrove, dock, oyster
reef and rubble habitats. Sonar videos will be processed to count the abundance
and measure the size of fish encountered, and will be converted to biomass. The
sonar surveys were designed and will be analyzed in similar ways to diver
surveys in clear water habitats with the exception that species ID is unknown.
This will allow for network-wide assessment of fish biomass and size structure
across clear and turbid water habitats in the TMON network. Similar surveys were
conducted in Chesapeake Bay during summer 2015.

<br> MarineGEO Central was very excited to learn that students are conducting
Squidpop Assays in the field! Kyle Ramos, a 6th grade student at St. Joseph
Catholic School in Stuart, FL won first prize for his work with Squidpops at his
school's science fair. Kyle worked with researcher Woody Lee at the Smithsonian
Marine Station to implement his research project. In addition, his worked was
awarded Best in Show, and as such he will be presenting his research at the
regional science fair in February! Kyle deployed his 'pops in five different
near-shore locations and found variable consumption rates of local predators
depending on habitat type. We all wish Kyle the best of luck as he moves on to
regionals! <br> <br> <br>

<a id="grants"> <h2>Successful Grants For MarineGEO Scientists</h2>

<br>

MarineGEO researchers support their work largely through competitive grants,
some offered through internal Smithsonian programs and some through external
funders.  If you have ideas for network- or team-based projects and would like
to discuss your ideas or propose partnership before applying for grants, please
contact us at: <a href="mailto:marinegeo@si.edu">MarineGEO@si.edu</a>.
Congratulations to the following teams for their successfully funded proposals.
Funded projects range from addressing network needs to supplementing
postdoctoral research to helping launch new sites through research and
education.




<br><br>

<b>PI:</b> Duffy JE, Murray MC <br> <b>Title:</b> Tennenbaum Marine
Observatories Network Field Campaign at Carrie Bow Cay, Belize <br>
<b>Award:</b> Level One Smithsonian Grand Challenges <br> <b>Amount:</b> $17,678
<br> <b>Description:</b> TMON requested funding to: establish standardized,
observational (monitoring) components of the MarineGEO core research program at
Carrie Bow Cay; test new protocols and train SI scientists and technicians in
their methods; collect the annual observational data about the foundational
habitats and marine biodiversity surrounding them; and provide educational
outreach experiences to visitors. This funding opportunity resulted in the <a
href =
"#expeditions">Carrie Bow Field Trip</a>.

<br><br>

<b>PI:</b> Miller W, Megonigal P <br> <b>Title:</b> A Scalable MarineGEO-TMON
Information System and Design Standard: Using Existing Network of Sonde, pCO2,
Weather and Tide Instruments/Data Streams <br> <b>Award:</b> Level One
Smithsonian Grand Challenges <br> <b>Amount:</b> $13,330 <br>
<b>Description:</b> A central requirement for the successful and effective
operation of the MarineGEO/TMON network is a Data Management System that enables
users to collect, process, and analyze scientific data. These data must be
properly curated from collection to archive, with appropriate annotation,
metadata, standardization, and quality assurance and control (QA/QC) measures
applied along the way. We propose using a structured relational database as the
basis for a MarineGEO/TMON Data Information System. The system would maintain a
central database structure for MarineGEO/TMON data, but with direct access to
MarineGEO/TMON nodes and scientists, such that local data managers/scientists
(who know their data best) can annotate and apply appropriate QA/QC protocols,
and access the data for analyses.

<br><br>

<b>PI:</b> Hagedorn M <br> <b>Title:</b> Next Gen Marine Science <br>
<b>Award:</b> Smithsonian Youth Access Award <br> <b>Amount:</b><br>
<b>Description:</b> To support the use of an intensive STEM program to engage
native and non-native high school students from at risk schools in field marine
science research projects centered on monitoring biodiversity of coral reefs in
Hawai'i, <i>Next Generation Marine Science</i> will: expand upon an existing
K-12 marine science program at Hawai’i Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB); offer
curricula and immersive hands-on training and research opportunities in marine
science technology; reveal to students the current status of invertebrates in
Kane 'ohe Bay; and expose them to the exciting intellectual and adventurous
field activities that are the foundation of a career in marine science.

<br><br>

<b>PI:</b> Leray M, Knowlton N, Duffy JE <br> <b>Title:</b>  <br> <b>Award:</b>
Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) Grant <br> <b>Amount:</b>$15,500<br>
<b>Description:</b> Our efforts to measure and therefore predict the cascading
effects of global environmental change have largely focused on small subsets of
communities, typically the larger, conspicuous, and taxonomically
well-documented groups.  This approach disregards the microscopic animals (<2mm)
that play a fundamental role in biochemical and nutrient cycling and which
comprise the vast majority of diversity in the sea. The Tennenbaum Marine
Observatories Network’s (TMON) MarineGEO initiative aims to quantify long-term
changes in biodiversity and its consequences for ecosystems across the globe. To
do so, we are using standardized sampling that combines Autonomous Reef
Monitoring Systems (ARMS), molecular methods, and digital imagery to directly
compare whole community profiles (integrating across all size class) through
time and space. Objectives are to (1) supplement the library of DNA barcodes for
key taxa at the TMON core sites, (2) provide DNA barcodes to identify OTUs
detected via metabarcoding, (3) quantify latitudinal gradients and successional
patterns in cryptobenthic diversity among taxa and size fractions, and 4) to
produce digitally associated barcodes, physical vouchers, and photographic
vouchers for these poorly known organisms.

<b>PI:</b> Edgar G, Jordan A, Knott, N, Barrett N, Howe S, Holmes T, Duffy JE
<br> <b>Title:</b> Improving prediction of rocky reef ecosystem responses to
human impacts <br> <b>Award:</b> Australian Research Council: Linkage Projects
<br> <b>Amount:</b>$900,000<br> <b>Description:</b> The project aims to add a
new functional dimension to the understanding of inshore ecosystems,
facilitating improved management of our living marine heritage. Project goals
are to: extend huge field datasets on the density and distribution of thousands
of marine fishes, invertebrates and macro-algae; combine these data using recent
advances in quantitative ecological modeling to describe transfer of biomass
between species at hundreds of sites with primary focus on southern Australia;
and provide site-level indices of major food web processes that, when combined
with ‘before, after, control, impact’ data, allow improved prediction of
ecological consequences of fishing, climate change, pest outbreaks, and
pollution.
